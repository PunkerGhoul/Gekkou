## Problem Statement

Explain clearly why this feature matters and who it benefits.
_Example:_

> Users can’t save drafts of their posts, so they lose work if their browser crashes.

---

## Proposed Solution

What do you want to achieve?
Describe your feature at a high level—what it does and how it fixes the problem.
_Example:_

> Enable “Save Draft” on the post editor with an automatic draft restore on reload.

## Technical Details

_Example:_

- **Endpoint(s) / Components**: which modules, services or screens will change
- **Data model**: new fields or DB tables, if any
- **Dependencies**: external libraries, feature flags, etc.
- **Security & Permissions**: who can access/use this feature

---

## Acceptance Criteria

List the measurable conditions for “done.”
_Example:_

- [ ] Drafts persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Draft autosave triggers every 30 seconds
- [ ] Users can manually click “Save Draft”
- [ ] UI indicates “Draft saved” status

---

## Alternatives Considered

What else did you look at? Why was it rejected?
_Example:_

> Autosave only on form change –> too chatty on the backend.
