## How to Report Issues

Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request enhancements. A well-formed issue includes:

* **Title**: short, descriptive summary.
* **Description**:

  * Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
  * Expected vs. actual behavior.
  * Nix / Home-Manager versions, OS, error logs.

Please respect issue templates and provide as much context as possible.

2. Make your changes in small, focused commits.
3. Update documentation or examples in `README.md` or Nix files as needed.
4. Run any existing tests or perform manual verification.
5. Push to your fork:

## Branch Naming & Commit Messages

* **Branch prefix**: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`.
* **Format**: `<prefix>/<component>-<brief-description>` e.g. `feat/home-manager-modules`, `fix/env-example`

**Commit messages** should be:

* Written in English.
* Use the imperative mood: `Add`, `Fix`, `Remove`.
* Reference the type: `[FEAT]`, `[BUG]`, `[DOC]`, etc.

Example:

```markdown
[FEAT] modules: Add new `ripgrep` helper function
```

---

## Code Style & Testing

* Follow existing Nix and shell conventions in this repo.
* Keep your changes idempotent and reproducible with Home-Manager.
* If you add new modules or scripts, consider how they integrate with `home.nix`.
* Manual verification is required:

  * Reload your Home-Manager config:

    ```bash
    home-manager switch -f ./home.nix
    ```

  * Verify the expected behaviour on your system.
